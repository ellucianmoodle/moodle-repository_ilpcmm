The ILP CMM plugins support the uploading of documents and links into Moodle courses from the Course Materials Manager (CMM), a component of Ellucianâ€™s Colleague Portal. The CMM is a repository of documents and links that faculty can use to maintain materials for their courses. The ILP CMM plugins are of value only to Ellucian clients who have licensed the Colleague Portal and installed the Portal and CMM.

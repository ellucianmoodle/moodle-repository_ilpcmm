INSTALLATION STEPS

Perform the following steps to install the ILP CMM plugins with Moodle.

Step 1. Perform these steps to install the "CMM - Copy File to Moodle" plugin:
 - On the Moodle website (http://moodle.org), go to Downloads > Plugins.
 - Search for “cmm” to locate the CMM plugins pages. Use the “Search plugins” search rather than the “Search moodle.org” search in order to limit the search results to plugins only.
 - From the search results page, go to the “CMM - Copy File to Moodle” page.
 - Download the zip file to a location on your Moodle server and extract the folders and files.
 - From the extracted files, copy the entire datatelcmm folder into the repository folder under your Moodle installation.

Step 2. Perform these steps to install the "CMM - Link to Course Material" plugin:
 - Return to the search results page and go to the “CMM - Link to Course Material” page.
 - Download the zip file to a location on your Moodle server and extract the folders and files.
 - From the extracted files, copy the entire datatelcmmlinks folder into the  repository folder under your Moodle installation.

Step 3. Access your Moodle site as an administrator.

The first time that you access the Moodle site after installing the Plugin folders, you should see the Plugins Check page. If you do not see that page, go to the Settings block, expand the Site Administration category and then click Notifications.

Step 5. On the Plugins Check page, click Upgrade.
